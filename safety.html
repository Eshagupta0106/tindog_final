    <h1 style="text-decoration:overline;">Dating Safety Tips with our Dogs</h1>
    <p>Meeting new people is exciting, but you should always be cautious when interacting with someone you don’t know.
      Use your best judgment and put your safety first, whether you are exchanging initial messages or meeting in person.
      While you can’t control the actions of others, there are things you can do to help you stay safe during your Tindog experience.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Dogs Safety</h3><br>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
      <li>
        <h4>Keep your dog on a leash in public places </h4>
        <p>Even if your dog is well trained an well behaved, always keep him or her on a leash when you walk in a public place. Dogs may be distracted by unexpected noises or activities or may be drawn to something further away from you.
          Just imagine what could happen if your pet wants to see what’s going on across the street as a car speeds by? With your dog on a leash you have control over where he or she goes, and it also allows you to keep your pet away from people, or
          other animals, who may be afraid of dogs.
        </p><br>

        <h4>Never allow your dog to wander off alone</h4>
        <p>
          Never allow your dear pup to walk away without you. There are many hazards that could await once your pet is away from your property or out of your sight. Some people may not appreciate having a unknown dog wandering around their garden,
          even
          if it is friendly and well-behaved. As an owner, it’s your responsibility to make sure that your pet stays where he or she is allowed to be.

        <h4> Basic commands and obedience training </h4>
        <p>
          We teach our children important, basic commands to keep them safe and stop them from running out in front of a car or putting something dangerous in their mouth. For the same reasons, dogs should also be taught certain commands. Whether you
          take your dog to the park, to the vet or for a simple walk, dangers can occur, and no dog is smart enough to realize every single danger he can get himself into. There are automobiles, open wells, bikes, and he can get trapped in places
          where
          he cannot get out.
        </p>

        <h4> Be aware that some foods are bad for dogs </h4>
        <p>Offering a pet “people food” isn’t just promoting bad pet manners, but it can actually be quite dangerous for our four-legged friends. As a dog owner you should know the common foods that are bad for dogs. Most people are aware that
          chocolate can be very harmful in certain quantities. Other foods that are potentially toxic to dogs include avocado, onions, garlic, grapes, raisins, macadamia nuts, raw eggs, candy and anything with caffeine in it.

      <li>
        <h4> Check the condition of all your pet’s toys </h4>
        <p>You maybe don’t think about it, but old, broken dog toys can be quite dangerous. Make a point to regularly check your pet’s toys and look for wear and tear. Anything that’s cracked, splintered or ragged should be thrown away so it doesn’t
          become a choking hazard.
        </p>

        <h4> Keep your dog mentally and physically healthy </h4>
        <p> In order to stay healthy and fit, and to fight disease, dogs need both mental and physical stimulation on a daily basis. A normal healthy dog will benefit from 2 exercise sessions a day. Off-leash exercises in the garden, playtime in the
          park, swimming, running and walking are all perfect ways to keep your pup in shape. But don’t forget mental stimulation! Mental training sessions keep a dog’s brain sharp, as well as help develop and strengthen the bond between dog and
          human. Try
          to make it fun (for both of you) and avoid boring or repetitive activities.

        <h4> Keep your dog safe with a gps tracker </h4>
        <p>
          Lack of protection means that less than 20% of lost dogs are reunited with their owners. Fortunately, a Tractive GPS Tracker helps families find their lost pets, no matter how far away they are. With a Tractive GPS Tracker dog owners can
          locate
          their four-legged friends – anytime, anywhere, and see the current position of their furry companion in a browser or conveniently on their smartphone. Curious to find out more benefits of Tractive GPS?

      <li>
        <h4> Put away all dangerous, chewable items </h4>
        <p>If something is potentially dangerous for your pet to put in his or her mouth (wires, scissors, glue, medicine), move it to a higher elevation or put it in closet or drawer. A dog that hasn’t shown interest in an object yet may get bored
          and
          seek it out later when you’re not around. When an item is kept out of your dog’s reach, then he or she will be far less likely to chew on it.
        </p>

      <li>
        <h4> Make a dog first aid kit</h4>
        <p> A dog first aid kit is very important to have at home or to bring when you go on holiday. Your kit should include the same kinds of things you would expect in a kit made for humans, such as gauze, medical tape, an antiseptic product,
          hydrogen
          peroxide, thermometer, your pet’s medical records and contact information for his or her vet and nearby emergency clinics.
